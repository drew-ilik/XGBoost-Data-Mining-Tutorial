# XGBoost-Data-Mining-Tutorial
A practical demonstration of XGBoost for data mining applications.


## üìñ Overview

This project is an independent implementation of an XGBoost lesson I explored after completing the Data Mining course at Villanova University.
- It does not include proprietary class materials.
- It is designed for educational purposes in Python.
- Those currently enrolled in the course are encouraged to complete the official lesson to ensure proper learning outcomes.

## üñ• Who This Is For
This tutorial is written for people who are comfortable using software like Microsoft Excel or JMP for data analytics but have limited or no prior experience with Python.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions (Windows)

1. Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org/downloads.
When installing, check "Add Python to PATH".

2. Download This Repository
Click the green Code button on this page, then Download ZIP.
Unzip the folder to a location you can find easily, like Desktop.

3. Open a Terminal
Right click the Windows key and select Terminal

4. Navigate to the Project Folder
Replace path below with your actual folder path:
`cd "C:\Users\user\Desktop\XGBoost-Data-Mining-Tutorial"`

5. Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment is a self‚Äëcontained folder that keeps this project‚Äôs Python packages separate from everything else on your computer.
It prevents version conflicts and makes the tutorial reproducible.
`python -m venv .venv`

6. Activate the Virtual Environment
`.venv\Scripts\activate`
You‚Äôll see (.venv) at the start of the line ‚Äî that means it‚Äôs active.

7. Install Required Packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook

8. Launch Jupyter Notebook
`jupyter notebook`

A browser window will open. Click XGBoost_Data_Mining_Tutorial.ipynb to view and run the tutorial.
